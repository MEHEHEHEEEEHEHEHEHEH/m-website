            <h2>Project Experience</h2>
            <p>
               In this project, I really enjoyed my partner.
I don’t hate my partner. If I am paired with someone who I severely don’t like, I can’t do ANYTHING. I will also work pretty slow and I won’t enjoy doing the assignment.

            </p>
            <p>
               It was difficult for me to do HTML because its not as simple and straight-forward as CSS. In CSS you just have to add “-” between wor
               ds and : then end it with ;. I learned that small details like forgetting a punctuation or a  typo can really affect th
               e code. I was also having trouble following the instructions. I fixed it by asking Pak John, my partner and Stefanie for help. 
               This taught me that don’t be afraid to ask questions  and for help.

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>
               While building it, I used tools like Visual Studio Code and W3schools.  I think being an engineer means to de
               velop a plan or system to address a specific problem or need. 
            <p>
                Even though AI can build websites, I think it’s still important to learn because you would underst
                and more about it. If you just look at AI, you wouldn’t really experience coding and the stressfulness.
                Now that I’ve made one myself (mostly), I understand things like how to code using CSS and HTML. I also learned how t
                o be patient and solve problems. If I only relied on AI, I might miss out on understanding how to code using CSS and
                 HTML and you wouldn't have fun as much.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Through this project ,I learned that you have to be patient. I learned this when I was waiting for Pak Jo
                hn to help me. When I was waiting for him impatiently, time went by SOOO SLOW. But when I waited patiently I was 
                FINE.  I also learned that you should ask for help if you don’t know something.
